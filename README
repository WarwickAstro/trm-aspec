'trm.aspec' is, I hope, a temporary measure to compute amplitude spectra
using code modified from Jake Vanderplas' lombscargle package. It exposes
a single function, amp_spec, to do this. I am hoping that Jake Vanderplas
will add something equivalent as an option in lombscargle, but in the
meantime, this does the job.

Installation:

You need numpy and a recent enough astropy to have astropy.stats.lombscargle
Then its just the usual

 python setup.py install --prefix=your_top_level_installation_directory

or

 python setup.py install --user

if you want store in .local in your home directory.
